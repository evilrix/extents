SPECIFICATION

Design a program to read a list of number pairs representing closed ranges from
a file called "extents.txt". It should also read a list of points from a file
called "numbers.txt".  Example files and format specifications are given below.

The required function of your code is to write, to standard output, the number
of ranges that contain each point. You should maintain the same ordering as the
input points, one result per line. A point P is contained within a closed range
[X,Y] if X <= P <= Y.

"extents.txt" contains the ranges, one per line, with each line in the format
"A <whitespace> B". The maximum size of this file is fifty million entries.
"numbers.txt" contains a list of points, one per line. The number of points is
potentially extremely large, perhaps numbering many billions. Either file may
contain a number of duplicates, and may or may not end with a <newline>.

The input can be assumed to be valid, given the above specification, and all
numbers can be represented by unsigned integers.

All code should be in a file called extents.cpp.

Example 1:
        extents.txt
        0 11
        105 121
        122 123
        11 32

        numbers.txt
        1
        2
        5
        13
        62
        28
        62
        16
        33

        output
        1
        1
        1
